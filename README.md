- 👋 Hi, I’m Jim, Im married with 7 children (and a dog). I have an honors degree in IT and Computing but working fulltime in a non software development role where I am frustratingly unable to use what I have learned. I have been interested in programming for as long as i can remember but still trying to get good at it.
- 👀 I’m interested in changing career, moving into software development, hopefully soon as im in my 50s, am i too late?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bits and pieces, main focus is python, django and github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that i can do fairly quickly and will help someone else
- 📫 How to reach me, best by email j.sloss@btinternet.com
